Instructions for Stock Portfolio Management Problem

It's wise to develop your program bit by bit.  You may
want to initially focus on just reading the files correctly.
You can test that by just printing the arrays for names and
prices out and seeing that they agree with the input file
data.

Then work on each statistic by itself, starting with the
easier ones.  You can compare the results you get for each
company with my output files.

Once you have completed all of the statistics and have
the output display arranged properly, you should go over
your program to make sure the format is good(Netbeans can do
that for you), identifiers are good, and that it is 
adequately documented.
